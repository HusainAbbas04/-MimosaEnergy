Detailed Project Summary: Mimosa Energy Simulation
Project Goals:
Simulate Real-Life Mimosa Energy Production: Create a realistic simulation of Mimosa plants generating energy.

Explore Self-Sustainable Energy: Demonstrate the potential of Mimosa plants as a source of self-sustainable energy.

Stages of the Project:
Initial Setup and Basic Functionality:

Create Main Window: Set up the main Tkinter window for the simulation.

Display Plant Image: Add and display the Mimosa plant image in the window.

Interactive Features:

Plant Image Interaction: Make the plant image interactive, changing on click to simulate the Mimosa plant's response and generating an energy spike.

Data Visualization:

Matplotlib Chart: Create a real-time updating chart with Matplotlib to visualize energy production.

Initialize Data Lists: Set up lists to store time and energy data for real-time updates.

Real-Time Updates:

Implement Live Updates: Ensure the chart updates every second, maintaining a smooth and continuous flow of data.

Energy Spike Simulation: Each click generates an energy spike between 0.5 and 2 ÂµW, returning to near-baseline levels.

Enhanced Visualization:

Add Grid Lines: Configure Matplotlib to show both horizontal and vertical grid lines.

Visual Styling: Add colors and styles to the chart for better visual appeal.

Smooth Updates: Confirm the chart updates smoothly every second, avoiding any cramped or fast-paced appearance.

Advanced Features:

Sensors: Integrate sensors to detect plant movements and generate corresponding energy data.

Flow Chart: Develop a flow chart to map out the entire energy production and utilization process.

Flywheel: Simulate the flywheel mechanism to store and release energy in a controlled manner.

Energy Levels:

Single Plant: Visualize energy production from a single Mimosa plant.

Multiple Plants: Scale up to visualize energy production from 100 Mimosa plants.

Battery System: Integrate a battery system to store generated energy and show charge/discharge cycles.

Data Logging:

Save Data to CSV: Log energy production data to a CSV file periodically.

Efficient Storage: Implement a strategy to limit file size by keeping only recent data.

Implemented Features:
Interactive Plant Image:

The plant image changes when clicked, simulating the Mimosa plant closing its leaves.

Each click generates an energy spike between 0.5 and 2 ÂµW.

Matplotlib Chart:

A real-time updating chart that displays energy production over time.

Initializes with empty data lists for continuous updates.

Real-Time Updates:

The chart updates every second, maintaining a smooth and continuous flow of data.

Keeps only the last 60 seconds of data for efficient memory usage.

Planned Enhancements:
Grid Lines and Visual Improvements:

Add both horizontal and vertical grid lines to the chart for better readability.

Implement color and styling to make the chart visually appealing.

Smooth Live Updates:

Ensure the chart updates every second in a smooth and natural manner, avoiding any cramped or fast-paced appearance.

Energy Spikes Behavior:

Each plant click generates a realistic energy spike that returns to near-baseline levels.

Maintain a consistent spike range between 0.5 and 2 ÂµW, with slight fluctuations around the baseline after the spike.

Advanced Features Integration:

Sensors: Detect plant movements and generate corresponding energy data.

Flow Chart: Visualize the energy production and utilization process.

Flywheel: Store and release energy in a controlled manner.

Battery System: Manage and visualize charge/discharge cycles for sustainable energy storage.

Next Steps:
Implement Grid Lines and Styling:

Add grid lines and enhance the visual styling of the chart.

Ensure Smooth Live Updates:

Confirm the chart updates smoothly every second.

Improve Energy Spike Visualization:

Ensure energy spikes return to near-baseline levels realistically and continuously reflect new spikes with each plant click.

Integrate Advanced Features:

Integrate sensors, develop a flow chart, simulate a flywheel mechanism, and implement a battery system.

Summary of Recent Code Adjustments:
Block 08: Integrated live updates with the live_update() function directly defined within the block.

Block 09: Defined the update_chart() and live_update() functions for real-time data updates.
